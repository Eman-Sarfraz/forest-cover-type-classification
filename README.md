### **Forest Cover Type Classification**
ðŸ“Œ Project Description
This project predicts the type of forest cover based on various cartographic and environmental features using the Covertype dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset contains 581,012 instances with 54 features, including both continuous and categorical data.
ðŸŽ¯ ## **Objectives**
- Clean and preprocess the dataset, including handling categorical variables
- Train and evaluate multiple machine learning models for multi-class classification
- Visualize performance metrics such as confusion matrices and ROC curves
- Analyze feature importances for interpretability
- Compare Random Forest and XGBoost models with hyperparameter tuning
ðŸ—‚ ## **Dataset**
Dataset: Covertype (UCI Machine Learning Repository)
Link: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/covertype
Features include elevation, aspect, slope, soil type, and wilderness area.
ðŸ›  Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost

ðŸ“Š ## **Workflow**
1. Load and explore the dataset
2. Data preprocessing (scaling, encoding categorical variables)
3. Train-test split
4. Model training (Random Forest, XGBoost)
5. Model evaluation (classification report, confusion matrix, ROC curve)
6. Feature importance visualization
7. Hyperparameter tuning for improved performance
ðŸ“ˆ ## **Visualizations**
- Confusion Matrix for model performance comparison
- ROC Curve comparison across models
- Feature importance bar charts
